HarmonyCombos
=============

Harmony Combinator is a generator of musical chords (V - I) as it would be done by classical composers, in particular at the time of J.S. Bach.
This application generates chords by starting from a major tonalty and some basic rules that can be activated.

This project is at the beginning: the code is not elegant and has to be fixed in some aspects. It is a starting point for who want to work with the ability of a computer to combine musical notes into chords.
